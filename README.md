# project-vanilla-pudding-server
Node.js api server for project-vanilla-pudding

## Getting Started

1. `npm install` to install all dependencies.
2. `source env.sh` to set up your dev environment -- **IMPORTANT** the server won't run unless NODE\_PATH is set correctly, so sourcing this script is required.
3. `npm install knex -g` (/w `sudo` if needed) to install the knex cmd-line client
4. `knex migrate:latest` to migrate to the latest version of the database
